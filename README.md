# WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGES SOLUTIONS

A collection of simple JavaScript challenges solutions designed to practice user interaction, arithmetic calculations, and conditional logic.

## Description
This repository contains the code solutions for three distinct JavaScript challenges. 

The challenges include:

1.  **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator**: Calculates the ingredients needed to brew a specified number of cups of Kenyan chai.
2.  **Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator**: Estimates the fare for a boda boda ride based on distance traveled.
3.  **Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator**: Simulates transaction fee calculations for mobile money transfers, accounting for minimum and maximum fee caps.

## File Structure

The project is organized with three folders namely:

1. **bodaFareCalculator**: Contains fare.js.
2. **chaiCalculator**: Contains chai.js.
3. **mobileMoneyEstimator**: Contains fees.js.
